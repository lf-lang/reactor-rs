// because ids were not allocated consecutively. We were previously using
// hashmaps, now we use IndexVec.
// Also the structure of GlobalId used to set relatively low
// ceilings on the number of components and reactions of each
// reactor. Previously, we could have max 2^16 (reactions+components)
// per reactor. Now we can have 2^16 reactions per reactor,
// and range(usize) total components.
